                    <p> <b> Introduction </b><br>
                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                        <br>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                        <br>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                        This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.

                    <p><b>Getting started with JavaScript</b><br>
                        Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using the most recent version of Firefox is recommended.

                        The Web Console tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript; you can use it into two modes: single-line input mode, and multi-line input mode.
                        <br>
                        Single-line input in the Web Console
                        The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a JavaScript interpreter that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.

                        To open the Web Console (Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows and Linux or Cmd-Option-K on Mac), open the Tools menu in Firefox, and select "Developer ▶ Web Console". 

                        The Web Console appears at the bottom of the browser window. The console works the exact same way as eval: the last expression entered is returned. For the sake of simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actually surrounded by console.log around eval, like so: Press Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!
                        <br>
                        In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications.

                        But for now, remember to always include the (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code. You will learn what these mean, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:

                        Massively improve performance.
                        Prevent semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.
                        Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).

                        Comments
                        The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:

                        // a one line comment <br> Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution. <br> Declarations
                        JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.
                        <br>
                        var
                        Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                        let
                        Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
                        const
                        Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant. You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                        <br>
                        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).

                        Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).

                        You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.

                        Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.

                        Declaring variables You can declare a variable in two ways:
                        <br>
                        With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.
                        With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)
                        You can declare variables to unpack values from Object Literals using the Destructuring Assignment syntax. For example, let { bar } = foo. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.  

                        You can also simply assign a value to a variable For example, x = 42. This form creates an undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.

                        Block statement
                        The most basic statement is a block statement, which is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets: <br> Conditional statements
                        A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch.

                        if...else statement
                        Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false.
                        <br>
                        An if statement looks like this: <br> Conditional statements

                        undefined
                        null

                        NaN
                        the empty string ("")
                        All other values—including all objects—evaluate to true when passed to a conditional statement.

                <section class="content" id="Loops">
                    <p><b>Loops</b> <br>
                        Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.

                        You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop: <br> There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

                        The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

                        The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:
                        <br>
                        for statement
                        do...while statement
                        while statement
                        labeled statement
                        break statement
                        continue statement
                        for...in statement 
                        for...of statement  
                    </p>

                <section class="content" id="Functions">
                    <p><b>Functions</b><br>
                        Defining functions
                        Function declarations
                        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

                        The name of the function.
                        A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
                        For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                        <br>
                        function square(number) {
                        return number * number;
                        }
                        The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The statement return specifies the value returned by the function:

                        return number * number;
                        Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.

                        If you pass an object (i.e. a non-primitive value, such as Array or a user-defined object) as a parameter and the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function, as shown in the following example: <br> function myFunc(theObject) {
                            theObject.make = 'Toyota';
                        }
                        <br>
                        var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};
                        var x, y;
                        
                        x = mycar.make; // x gets the value "Honda"
                        
                        myFunc(mycar);
                        y = mycar.make; // y gets the value "Toyota"
                                        // (the make property was changed by the function)
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section class="content" id="Regular Expressions">
                    <p><b>Regular Expressions</b><br>
                        Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the exec() and test() methods of RegExp, and with the match(), matchAll(), replace(), replaceAll(), search(), and split() methods of String. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions. <br> Creating a regular expression
                        You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:
                        
                        Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes, as follows:
                        
                        let re = /ab+c/;
                        Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.
                        
                        Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:
                        <br>
                        let re = new RegExp('ab+c');
                        Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input. <br> Writing a regular expression pattern
                        A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as /abc/, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as /ab*c/ or /Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/. The last example includes parentheses, which are used as a memory device. The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later use, as described in Using groups.
                        <br>
                        Note: If you are already familiar with the forms of a regular expression, you may also read the cheatsheet for a quick lookup for a specific pattern/construct.
                        <br>
                        Using simple patterns
                        Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence "abc" occurs (all characters together and in that order). Such a match would succeed in the strings "Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane designs evolved from slabcraft." In both cases the match is with the substring "abc". There is no match in the string "Grab crab" because while it contains the substring "ab c", it does not contain the exact substring "abc".
                        
                        Using special characters
                        When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, you can include special characters in the pattern. For example, to match a single "a" followed by zero or more "b"s followed by "c", you'd use the pattern /ab*c/: the * after "b" means "0 or more occurrences of the preceding item." In the string "cbbabbbbcdebc", this pattern will match the substring "abbbbc".
                        
                        The following pages provide lists of the different special characters that fit into each category, along with descriptions and examples.
                        <br>
                        Assertions
                        Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible (including look-ahead, look-behind, and conditional expressions).
                        Character classes
                        Distinguish different types of characters. For example, distinguishing between letters and digits.
                        Groups and ranges
                        Indicate groups and ranges of expression characters.
                        Quantifiers
                        Indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.
                        Unicode property escapes
                        Distinguish based on unicode character properties, for example, upper- and lower-case letters, math symbols, and punctuation.

                    <p><b>Client-side web APIs</b><br>
                        When writing client-side JavaScript for web sites or applications, you will quickly encounter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs are programming features for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or manipulating data from other web sites or services. In this module, we will explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work. <br> Introduction to web APIs
                        First up, we'll start by looking at APIs from a high level — what are they, how do they work, how do you use them in your code, and how are they structured? We'll also take a look at what the different main classes of APIs are, and what kind of uses they have.
                        Manipulating documents <br>
                        When writing web pages and apps, one of the most common things you'll want to do is manipulate web documents in some way. This is usually done by using the Document Object Model (DOM), a set of APIs for controlling HTML and styling information that makes heavy use of the Document object. In this article, we'll look at how to use the DOM in detail, along with some other interesting APIs that can alter your environment in interesting ways.
                        Fetching data from the server
                        Another very common task in modern websites and applications is retrieving individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entirely new page. This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact on the performance and behavior of sites.  In this article, we'll explain the concept, and look at technologies that make it possible, such as XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API. <br> Third party APIs
                        The APIs we've covered so far  are built into the browser, but not all APIs are. Many large websites and services such as Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook, PayPal, etc. provide APIs allowing developers to make use of their data (e.g. displaying your twitter stream on your blog) or services (e.g. displaying custom Google Maps on your site, or using Facebook login to log in your users). This article looks at the difference between browser APIs and 3rd party APIs and shows some typical uses of the latter.
                        Drawing graphics <br>
                        The browser contains some very powerful graphics programming tools, from the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) language, to APIs for drawing on HTML <canvas> elements, (see The Canvas API and WebGL). This article provides an introduction to the Canvas API, and further resources to allow you to learn more.

                        HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — <video> and <audio> — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. This article shows you how to do common tasks such as creating custom playback controls.
                        Client-side storage
                        Modern web browsers feature a number of different technologies that allow you to store data related to web sites and retrieve it when necessary allowing you to persist data long term, save sites offline, and more. This article explains the very basics of how these work.</p>

                        Memory life cycle
                        Regardless of the programming language, the memory life cycle is pretty much always the same:

                        Allocate the memory you need
                        Use the allocated memory (read, write)
                        Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore
                        The second part is explicit in all languages. The first and last parts are explicit in low-level languages but are mostly implicit in high-level languages like JavaScript.

                        Allocation in JavaScript
                        Value initialization
                        In order to not bother the programmer with allocations, JavaScript will automatically allocate memory when values are initially declared.
                        <br>
                        var n = 123; // allocates memory for a number
                        var s = 'azerty'; // allocates memory for a string 

                        var o = {
                        a: 1,
                        b: null
                        }; // allocates memory for an object and contained values

                        // (like object) allocates memory for the array and 
                        // contained values
                        var a = [1, null, 'abra']; 
                        <br>
                        function f(a) {
                        return a + 2;
                        } // allocates a function (which is a callable object)

                        // function expressions also allocate an object
                        someElement.addEventListener('click', function() {
                        someElement.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
                        }, false);
                        Allocation via function calls
                        Some function calls result in object allocation.

                        var d = new Date(); // allocates a Date object

                        var e = document.createElement('div'); // allocates a DOM element

                        Objects overview
                        Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life, tangible objects.

                        In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

                        Objects and properties
                        A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
                        <br>
                        objectName.propertyName
                        Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let's create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:
                        <br>
                        var myCar = new Object();
                        myCar.make = 'Ford';
                        myCar.model = 'Mustang';
                        myCar.year = 1969;
                        The above example could also be written using an object initializer, which is a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}):

                        var myCar = {
                            make: 'Ford',
                            model: 'Mustang',
                            year: 1969
                        };
                    </p>
