                    <p><b>BUSINESS-CAREER: </b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 1995, Elon, then 24, dropped out of Stanford University's graduate school for physics to start Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. Zip2 was an internet 'city guide' for newspapers. By linking business directories to online maps, Zip2 created the first online Yellow Pages.</li>
                     <br><li>In 1999, with $10 million from the Zip2 sale, Musk co-founded X.com, an online payment processing platform that grew into PayPal. eBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion in stock, of which $165 million went to Musk, who owned 11.7% of the company's shares.</li>
                     <br>  <li>In 2002, Musk poured $1 million into Everdream, founded three years earlier by his cousin Lyndon Rive. Everdream was a provider of 'Software as a Service' (SaaS) that enabled its customers and partners to easily and affordably manage PCs from anywhere in the world. In 2007, Everdream was acquired by Dell for an undisclosed sum. </li>
                     <br>   <li>In that same year, Musk spent $100 million on founding aerospace company Space Exploration Technologies â€“ SpaceX for short. One of the goals of SpaceX is to making space launch rockets re-usable, which would reduce the cost of launches by a factor 10. By 2016, SpaceX had re-landed its first rocket. Another goal is to take humans to Mars, by 2024. Musk has stated that he wants to establish a colony with a population of 80,000 on the Red Planet by 2040. SpaceX is now worth around $21 billion. </li>
                     <br>   <li>Tesla was founded in 2003, but Musk came on board only a year later, investing $70 million. He became the company's CEO in 2008. Tesla not only sells its own electric cars, but also supplies electric powertrains for electric models by Smart, Mercedes and Toyota. </li>
                     <br>   <li>In 2005, Musk invested $1 million in Game Trust, an online gaming app developer founded by his former roommate Adeo Ressi.</li>
                     <br>  <li>And in 2006, he invested $35 million in SolarCity, co-founded by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive. </li>
                        <li>In 2013, Musk revealed his plans for a 'hyperloop': a system of intercity transport by shooting passenger capsules at speeds of up to 760 mph (1,200 km/h) through low-pressure tubes.</li>
